# Project-1--Matching Mahjong :turtle:

## Browser based game created from HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScipt

## Intro:

The first Mahjong computer game was created in 1981 by Brodie Lockard. Brodie said that he based it off of the Chinese game "Turtle". There is some confusion with the original Mahjong four player game due to it's name and it uses the same tiles. Therefore it is also known as "Turtle", 'Shanghai Solitaire", "Taipei", and "Kyodai".

# Project-1--Mahjong Solitaire :turtle:

## Browser based game created from HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScipt

## Intro:

The first Solitaire computer game was programmed by Wes Cherry in 1988, according to wikipedia.com. It was first released in Microsoft Windows 3.0, and according to Microsoft telemetry, it was among the top 3 most used Windows programs. Also to note, in 2019 Microsoft Solitaire was inducted to The Strong National Museum of Play's World Video Game Hall of Fame. 

The first Mahjong computer game was created in 1981 by Brodie Lockard. Brodie said that he based it off of the Chinese game "Turtle". There is some confusion with the original Mahjong four player game due to it's name and it uses the same tiles. Therefore it is also known as "Turtle", 'Shanghai Solitaire", "Taipei", and "Kyodai".

Basic Game Play Instructions:

-This is a smaller version of Mahjong Solitaire. There are only 90 tiles that are layed out in a pattern with one layer overlapping. 

-If a tile is exposed on either left or right side, then it can be clicked in order to match it to another tile and remove it from the board. 

-Your goal is find a match to each exposed tile and remove them from the board until their are no tiles. Then you WIN!!  :trophy:

If you find that you are stuck then you can choose to shuffle the tiles. 



### Next Steps: 

Furture Plans & Enhancements:

-Add all missing layers to make a full game of 144 tiles

-Add a timer to the game that is tied to score

-Add a points system to the game

-Add an automatic shuffle when the visible tiles on the board have no matches left

-Add an undo move button
